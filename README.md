# ABCB6

AMBER molecular dynamcics input files, post-equilibration starting system used to initiate replicate molecular dynamcics production simulations, and representative structures after triplicate 500 ns of production simulation of ABCB6 embedded in a model RBC membrane.

Systems simulated are: 
  1) human wild type ABCB6 (htABCB6_WT)
  2) human ABCB6 incorporating the L356P mutation (htABCB6_L356P)
  3) zebra fish wild type ABCB6 (zfABCB6_WT)
  4) zebra fish ABCB6 incorporating the corresponding L356P mutation (zfABCB6_L356P)
